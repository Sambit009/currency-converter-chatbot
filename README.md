## What is chat bot ?
A chatbot is a computer program that's designed to simulate human conversation. Users communicate with these tools using a chat interface or via voice, just like they would converse with another person. Chatbots interpret the words given to them by a person and provide a pre-set answer.  
Artificial intelligence, which brings into play machine learning and Natural language Processing (NLP) for building bot or chatbot, is specifically designed to unravel the smooth interaction between humans and computers.
